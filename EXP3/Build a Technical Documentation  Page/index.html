            <p>Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability. Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, Python has become one of the most popular programming languages in the world.</p>
            
            <p>Python's philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation. Its language constructs and object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small and large-scale projects.</p>
            
            <p>Python is dynamically typed and garbage-collected, supporting multiple programming paradigms including structured, object-oriented, and functional programming. It is often described as a "batteries included" language due to its comprehensive standard library.</p>

        <section class="main-section" id="Getting_Started">
            <header>Getting Started</header>
            <p>To begin programming in Python, you first need to install Python on your system. Python can be downloaded from the official Python website at python.org. The installation process varies depending on your operating system.</p>
            
            <p>After installation, you can verify that Python is correctly installed by opening a terminal or command prompt and typing the following command:</p>
            
            <div class="code-block">
                <code>python --version</code>
            </div>
            
            <p>This command will display the installed Python version. To start the Python interactive shell, simply type <code>python</code> or <code>python3</code> in your terminal.</p>
            
            <p>Your first Python program is traditionally the "Hello, World!" program. Here's how you write it:</p>
            
            <div class="code-block">
                <code>print("Hello, World!")</code>
            </div>
            
            <p>Python files use the <code>.py</code> extension. You can create a file named <code>hello.py</code> with the above code and run it using the command <code>python hello.py</code>.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="main-section" id="Variables_and_Data_Types">
            <header>Variables and Data Types</header>
            <p>In Python, variables are created when you assign a value to them. Unlike many other programming languages, Python does not require explicit declaration of variables or their types. The type is inferred automatically based on the value assigned.</p>
            
            <p>Python has several built-in data types, which can be categorized into the following groups:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Numeric Types:</strong> int, float, complex</li>
                <li><strong>Sequence Types:</strong> list, tuple, range</li>
                <li><strong>Text Type:</strong> str</li>
                <li><strong>Mapping Type:</strong> dict</li>
                <li><strong>Set Types:</strong> set, frozenset</li>
                <li><strong>Boolean Type:</strong> bool</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Here are examples of variable assignments with different data types:</p>
            
            <div class="code-block">
                <code># Integer
x = 10

# Float
y = 3.14

# String
name = "Python"

# Boolean
is_active = True

# List
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Dictionary
person = {"name": "Alice", "age": 30}</code>
            </div>
            
            <p>Python variables are dynamically typed, meaning you can reassign a variable to a different type at any time. Variable names must start with a letter or underscore and can contain letters, numbers, and underscores.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="main-section" id="Control_Flow">
            <header>Control Flow</header>
            <p>Control flow statements in Python allow you to control the execution of your code based on certain conditions. The primary control flow structures include if statements, for loops, and while loops.</p>
            
            <p>The <code>if</code> statement is used for conditional execution. It evaluates a condition and executes a block of code only if the condition is true:</p>
            
            <div class="code-block">
                <code>age = 18

if age >= 18:
    print("You are an adult")
elif age >= 13:
    print("You are a teenager")
else:
    print("You are a child")</code>
            </div>
            
            <p>Python uses indentation to define code blocks instead of curly braces or keywords. This is a fundamental aspect of Python's syntax and enforces code readability.</p>
            
            <p>The <code>for</code> loop is used to iterate over a sequence (such as a list, tuple, string, or range):</p>
            
            <div class="code-block">
                <code>fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

for fruit in fruits:
    print(f"I like {fruit}")</code>
            </div>
            
            <p>The <code>while</code> loop repeatedly executes a block of code as long as a condition remains true. It's important to ensure that the condition eventually becomes false to avoid infinite loops.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="main-section" id="Functions">
            <header>Functions</header>
            <p>Functions are reusable blocks of code that perform a specific task. In Python, functions are defined using the <code>def</code> keyword followed by the function name and parentheses containing any parameters.</p>
            
            <p>Functions help organize code into logical sections, promote code reuse, and make programs easier to understand and maintain. Here's a basic function example:</p>
            
            <div class="code-block">
                <code>def greet(name):
    """This function greets the person passed in as a parameter"""
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

# Calling the function
message = greet("Alice")
print(message)  # Output: Hello, Alice!</code>
            </div>
            
            <p>Functions can accept multiple parameters and can return values using the <code>return</code> statement. If no return statement is specified, the function returns <code>None</code> by default.</p>
            
            <p>Python also supports default parameter values, keyword arguments, and variable-length arguments. Here's an example with default parameters:</p>
            
            <div class="code-block">
                <code>def calculate_area(length, width=10):
    """Calculate area with default width"""
    return length * width

area1 = calculate_area(5)      # Uses default width: 50
area2 = calculate_area(5, 20)  # Uses provided width: 100</code>
            </div>
            
            <p>Functions in Python are first-class objects, meaning they can be assigned to variables, passed as arguments to other functions, and returned from functions. This enables powerful programming patterns like decorators and higher-order functions.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="main-section" id="Object_Oriented_Programming">
            <header>Object Oriented Programming</header>
            <p>Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that uses objects and classes to structure code. Python fully supports OOP principles including encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.</p>
            
            <p>A class is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines attributes (data) and methods (functions) that the objects created from the class will have. Here's how to define a simple class:</p>
            
            <div class="code-block">
                <code>class Dog:
    """A simple Dog class"""
    
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        """Initialize name and age attributes"""
        self.name = name
        self.age = age
    
    def bark(self):
        """Simulate a dog barking"""
        return f"{self.name} says Woof!"

# Creating an instance
my_dog = Dog("Buddy", 3)
print(my_dog.bark())  # Output: Buddy says Woof!</code>
            </div>
            
            <p>The <code>__init__</code> method is a special method called a constructor. It's automatically called when a new instance of the class is created. The <code>self</code> parameter refers to the instance being created and must be the first parameter of any method in the class.</p>
            
            <p>Inheritance allows a class to inherit attributes and methods from another class. This promotes code reuse and establishes a relationship between classes:</p>
            
            <div class="code-block">
                <code>class Animal:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
    
    def speak(self):
        pass

class Cat(Animal):
    def speak(self):
        return f"{self.name} says Meow!"

my_cat = Cat("Whiskers")
print(my_cat.speak())  # Output: Whiskers says Meow!</code>
            </div>
            
            <p>OOP in Python provides a powerful way to structure your programs, making them more modular, scalable, and easier to maintain. Understanding classes and objects is essential for working with many Python frameworks and libraries.</p>
